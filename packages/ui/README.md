# @dock108/ui

Shared UI primitives (logo, header, buttons, tiles, theme tokens) for every Dock108 surface.

## Usage

```tsx
import "@dock108/ui/theme.css";
import { DockHeader, DockFooter, Card } from "@dock108/ui";
```

All apps should import the global theme in their root `layout.tsx` so fonts, colors, and components stay consistent.
