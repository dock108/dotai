# Conspiracy Theory Surface (placeholder)

This UI experiments with myth-busting presents of conspiratorial content.

## Planned slices
- Intake claims + supporting links, grade plausibility, cite sources.
- Highlight missing evidence + data provenance to avoid misinformation.
- Offer shareable cards with context disclaimers.

Launch once guardrails + moderation coverage are complete.
