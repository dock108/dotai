# Crypto Theory Surface (placeholder)

Focuses on on-chain, macro, and trading structure hypotheses.

## Planned slices
- Connect to `data-workers` for OHLCV, funding rates, whale alerts.
- Provide risk scenarios (bull/base/bear) + playbooks tied to wallet size.
- Highlight data gaps (e.g., missing on-chain metrics, oracle delays).

Awaiting shared UI kit + FastAPI endpoints.
