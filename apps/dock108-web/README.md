# dock108 Web Hub (todo)

This folder will house the marketing/docs experience for dock108 (Next.js or Remix). It should link every theory surface, explain the guardrail philosophy, and host long-form launches.

## Planned features
- Landing page describing theory engine + guardrails
- Links to bets/crypto/stocks/conspiracy/playlist tools
- Auth-protected editorials + theory library once the backend exists

## Tech stack (target)
- Next.js 15 (App Router) + React Server Components
- Tailwind + shared `packages/ui-kit`
- Contentlayer (or MDX) for docs + release notes

## Status
Only the directory scaffold exists. Clone `apps/playlist-web` tooling to jumpstart once designs are ready.
