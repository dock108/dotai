# dock108 Monorepo

A unified platform for AI-powered theory evaluation across multiple domains. This monorepo contains all dock108 surfaces: theory evaluation engines (bets, crypto, stocks, conspiracies), sports highlight generation, and a prompting game. Every surface shares the same Python backend, guardrails, and shared UI components, enabling rapid development and consistent user experiences.

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-domain theory evaluation** with domain-specific analysis and guardrails
- **Sports betting data ingestion** with boxscore and odds scraping
- **Sports highlight playlist generation** with AI-powered parsing
- **Shared UI components** for consistent branding across all apps
- **Centralized infrastructure** with Docker Compose and Traefik routing

## Sports Highlight Channel Feature

The Sports Highlight Channel feature allows users to build custom YouTube playlists of sports highlights using natural language. The system:

1. **Parses user requests** using AI to extract sport, teams, dates, and content preferences
2. **Searches YouTube** for relevant highlight videos using official channels and major sports networks
3. **Scores and filters** videos based on relevance, channel reputation, freshness, and view counts
4. **Builds playlists** that match requested duration with intelligent caching to reduce API costs
5. **Provides explanations** showing assumptions, filters applied, and ranking factors

### Quick Start

For comprehensive local development and testing instructions, see **[`docs/LOCAL_DEPLOY.md`](docs/LOCAL_DEPLOY.md)**.

**Quick summary:**
1. Install prerequisites: Python 3.11+, Node.js 18+, PostgreSQL 14+, `uv`, `pnpm`
2. Set up database (local PostgreSQL or Docker)
3. Get API keys: YouTube Data API, OpenAI API
4. Configure environment: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set all required values
5. Start backend: `cd services/theory-engine-api && uv sync && uv pip install -e ../../packages/py-core && alembic upgrade head && uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
6. Start frontend: `cd apps/highlights-web && pnpm install && pnpm dev`

### API Endpoints

**Highlights API:**
- `POST /api/highlights/plan` - Plan a highlight playlist from user query
- `GET /api/highlights/{playlist_id}` - Get detailed playlist information
- `POST /api/highlights/{playlist_id}/watch-token` - Generate temporary watch token (48-hour expiration)
- `GET /api/highlights/watch/{token}` - Access playlist via watch token
- `GET /api/highlights/metrics` - Get metrics (sports requested, avg duration, cache hit rate)
- `GET /api/highlights/metrics/csv` - Get metrics as CSV for dashboard

See [`docs/HIGHLIGHTS_API.md`](docs/HIGHLIGHTS_API.md) for detailed API documentation.

## Testing and Deployment

- **Local Development**: See `docs/LOCAL_DEPLOY.md` for comprehensive local setup and testing guide (Sports Highlight Channel feature)
- **Quick Start**: See `docs/START.md` for Docker-based quick start guide
- **Production Deployment**: See [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for full monorepo deployment guide (all services and apps)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** with `uv` package manager
- **Node.js 18+** with `pnpm`
- **PostgreSQL 14+** (local or Docker)
- **Redis** (for caching and Celery)
- **Docker and Docker Compose** (for infrastructure services)
- **API Keys**:
  - OpenAI API key (for LLM evaluation)
  - YouTube Data API key (for highlights feature)
  - Odds API key (for sports betting data, optional)

### Local Development

1. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd dock108
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys, passwords, and configuration
   # IMPORTANT: Set POSTGRES_PASSWORD and REDIS_PASSWORD in .env
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Python packages
   cd services/theory-engine-api
   uv sync
   uv pip install -e ../../packages/py-core
   
   # Node packages (from repo root)
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   cd infra
   ./docker-compose.sh up -d postgres redis
   # Or: docker-compose --env-file ../.env -f docker-compose.yml up -d postgres redis
   ```
   
   **Important**: The `.env` file in the repo root is the single source of truth for all passwords and configuration. Use `./docker-compose.sh` wrapper script (recommended) or explicitly pass `--env-file ../.env` when running docker-compose commands.

4. **Run database migrations**:
   ```bash
   cd services/theory-engine-api
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

5. **Start backend**:
   ```bash
   cd services/theory-engine-api
   uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

6. **Start frontend** (choose one):
   ```bash
   # Main portal
   cd apps/dock108-web && pnpm dev
   
   # Or specific app
   cd apps/theory-bets-web && pnpm dev
   ```

### Production Deployment

See [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete production deployment guide.

**Important**: All passwords and configuration come from the `.env` file in the repo root (single source of truth). When running docker-compose commands:
- Use `./docker-compose.sh` wrapper script (recommended - automatically loads `.env`)
- Or: `docker-compose --env-file ../.env -f docker-compose.yml <command>` (from `infra/` directory)
- Or: `docker-compose --env-file .env -f infra/docker-compose.yml <command>` (from repo root)

Never hardcode passwords in docker-compose.yml or other configuration files.
