# Legacy MVP - Deprecated

This folder contains the earliest prototype of the playlist curation feature.

## Status

**Deprecated**: This code is kept for reference only. The active implementation lives in `../src/`.

## What's Here

- Early Next.js App Router implementation
- Basic YouTube API integration
- Simple topic parsing and video filtering
- Initial playlist building logic

## Why Keep It

This folder is preserved to:
- Reference the original MVP approach
- Compare evolution of the codebase
- Learn from early design decisions

## Do Not Use

**Do not**:
- Import code from this folder
- Use this as a reference for new features
- Modify files in this folder

**Instead**:
- Use the active implementation in `../src/`
- Reference `../README.md` for current architecture
- See `docs/archive/highlight-phase-notes.md` for historical refactoring notes

## Migration Notes

The active implementation (`../src/`) includes:
- Enhanced topic parsing with RAG
- Improved video classification
- Better error handling
- Integration with theory-engine-api backend
- Shared UI components from `packages/ui-kit`
