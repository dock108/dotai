# Sports Highlight Channel - User Guide

## Overview

The Sports Highlight Channel lets you create custom YouTube playlists of sports highlights using a guided builder interface. Select sports, add filters, choose a time window, and set a duration to build your personalized highlight show.

## Getting Started

### Using the Builder

1. **Select sports** - Choose one or more sports from the checklist (NFL, NBA, MLB, etc.)
2. **Add filters** (optional):
   - **Teams** - Add up to 5 teams (e.g., "Kansas City Chiefs")
   - **Players** - Add up to 5 players (e.g., "Patrick Mahomes")
   - **Play types** - Add up to 5 play types (e.g., "touchdowns", "interceptions")
3. **Choose time window**:
   - Quick presets: Last 48 hours, Last 7 days, Last 14 days, Last 30 days
   - Custom range: Pick exact start and end dates
   - Historical: For classic runs or throwbacks
4. **Set duration** - Use slider (1-10 hours) or quick presets (1h, 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 10h)
5. **Add comments** (optional) - Additional context or preferences
6. **Build playlist** - Click "Build Highlight Show"
7. **Watch on YouTube** - Click "Play Show on YouTube" to open the playlist

### Quick Presets

Try these one-click presets:

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Select multiple sports** - Combine NFL, NBA, MLB, etc. for variety
2. **Use recent dates** - The system works best for highlights from the last 48 hours to 30 days
3. **Be specific with filters** - Add specific teams, players, or play types for targeted results
4. **Start broad, then narrow** - Try a general query first, then add filters
5. **Check the explanation** - See why videos were selected and how they were scored

- Adjust or remove date filters
- Check spelling of sport/league names
- Try a different time period

### "Rate Limit Exceeded"

**What it means:** The service is experiencing high demand.

**Solutions:**
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Use a cached playlist if available
- Try again during off-peak hours

### "Network Error"

**What it means:** Unable to connect to the service.

**Solutions:**
- Check your internet connection
- Try refreshing the page
- Disable VPN if using one
- Wait a moment and retry

### "Service Temporarily Unavailable"

**What it means:** The service has reached its daily API limit.

**Solutions:**

### Long Loading Times

**What it means:** The request is taking longer than usual (30+ seconds).

**Solutions:**

- Click "Cancel Request" if you want to try a different query
- Try a simpler or more general query
- Check your internet connection

## Limitations

### Content Availability

- Only returns videos available on YouTube
- Relies on official channels and major networks for quality
- No control over video availability or removal
- May not find content for very specific or obscure requests

### Duration Matching

- Target duration has ±10% tolerance
- May not find enough content for very specific requests
- No guarantee of exact duration match

### Date Parsing

- AI parsing may misinterpret ambiguous date requests
- "Last night" vs specific dates may vary
- Sport detection may fail for obscure sports or non-English queries

## Best Practices

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Try a general query first, then refine with the builder
2. **Use presets**: Quick presets are tested and work well
3. **Check the explanation**: Understanding why videos were selected helps refine future queries
4. **Save your queries**: Bookmark playlists you like for easy access later
5. **Be patient**: Complex queries may take 30+ seconds to process
