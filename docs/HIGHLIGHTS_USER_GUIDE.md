# Sports Highlight Channel - User Guide

## Overview

The Sports Highlight Channel lets you create custom YouTube playlists of sports highlights by describing what you want in natural language. Just tell us what you're looking for, and we'll search YouTube for the best matching videos and create a personalized playlist.

## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

1. **Enter your query** in the text box describing what you want
2. **Click "Build Playlist"** or use one of the quick presets
3. **Wait for the playlist to be created** (usually 10-30 seconds)
4. **Click "Play All on YouTube"** to watch your playlist

### Example Queries

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific about the sport**: Include the sport name (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, etc.)
2. **Include a time period**: Specify when you want highlights from (last night, this week, specific date)
3. **Specify content type**: Tell us if you want highlights, bloopers, top plays, etc.
4. **Request a duration**: Ask for a specific length (15 minutes to 8 hours)
5. **Combine requests**: You can ask for multiple things (e.g., "NFL then MLB highlights")

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### "No Videos Found"

- Adjust or remove date filters
- Check spelling of sport/league names
- Try a different time period

### "Rate Limit Exceeded"

**What it means:** The service is experiencing high demand.

**Solutions:**
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Use a cached playlist if available
- Try again during off-peak hours

### "Network Error"

**What it means:** Unable to connect to the service.

**Solutions:**
- Check your internet connection
- Try refreshing the page
- Disable VPN if using one
- Wait a moment and retry

### "Service Temporarily Unavailable"

**What it means:** The service has reached its daily API limit.

**Solutions:**

### Long Loading Times

**What it means:** The request is taking longer than usual (30+ seconds).

## Limitations

### Content Availability

- Only returns videos available on YouTube
- Relies on official channels and major networks for quality
- No control over video availability or removal
- May not find content for very specific or obscure requests

### Duration Matching

- Target duration has ±10% tolerance
- May not find enough content for very specific requests
- No guarantee of exact duration match

### Date Parsing

- AI parsing may misinterpret ambiguous date requests
- "Last night" vs specific dates may vary
- Sport detection may fail for obscure sports or non-English queries

## Best Practices

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Try a general query first, then refine with the builder
2. **Use presets**: Quick presets are tested and work well
3. **Check the explanation**: Understanding why videos were selected helps refine future queries
4. **Save your queries**: Bookmark playlists you like for easy access later
5. **Be patient**: Complex queries may take 30+ seconds to process
